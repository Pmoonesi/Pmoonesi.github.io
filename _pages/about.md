22 years old computer engineering student at Amirkabir University of Technology. I just love everything about computers and I mean everything. I have a passion for neuroscience and I want to contribute to the ongoing research about how our brain works in the future. 

In my free time, I like watching series such as House M.D., Ted Lasso and the latest I've watched, Vinland Saga. Furthermore, I sometimes play Counter-Strike Global-Offensive with my friends in my leisure time. For outside activities, I sometimes play football with my friends.
